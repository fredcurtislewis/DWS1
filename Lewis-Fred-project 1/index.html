    <h1 id="top"><strong>Disc Golf</strong></h1>
    <p>Much like its close cousing golf, disc golf is a sport of fierce competition. Structured in the same, disc golf consists of 18 holes, generally each being a par 3.</p>
    </header>
    <h2><strong>Courses</strong></h2>
    <p>You will generally find disc golf courses on or near parks, as the wide open space allows for some challengingly long holes, but you can also find them nestled in the forest. Depending on your skill level you may find that one is more fun than the other. Much like in golf a hole is usually 200-250 feet in length and may have turns or obstacles that make the hole more challenging.</p>

    <aside>   <h3><strong>Discs</strong></h3>
    <p><strong><em>There are three types of discs to use in disc golf:</em></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Driver</li>
        <li>Mid-Range</li>
        <li>Putter</li>
    </ul></aside>
    <p> The <em>Driver</em> is the disc of choice when teeing off (or taking the first shot on a hole). This disc is hard and designed to fly far and then drift either slightly left or slightly right, depending on the style disc you chose. The driver tends to have a lot of head spead and is not the type of frisbee you play catch with. These discs can be thrown to distances of over 400 feet. The world record driver was thrown 836 feet which can be seen on Innova Discs website by clicking <a href="http://www.innovadiscs.com/home/492-david-wiggins-jr-sets-new-distance-record-with-blizzard-champion-boss.html">here</a> Either way as a disc golfer, the Driver is the best tool you have to reach <q>par</q>!</p>
    <p> The <em>Mid-Range</em> is the disc one would use on approach or when you are near the basket, but out of range of your putter. This disc is most like a tradition frisbee and flies the straightest of all types of discs. Its design is for a straight shot under 120 feet, but it can be thrown much further once you figure out the grip and form required to get this disc moving. These discs are also very sturdy and can be used to punch out of trees if you land in the forest.</p>
    <p> The <em>Putter</em> is a disc designed to not only land in a metal basket, but if it does miss it is designed not to roll or spin a lot on the ground. This can be very useful to know and watching someone miss putting with their friver </p>
